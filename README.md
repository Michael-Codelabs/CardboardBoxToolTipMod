# üì¶ Cardboard Box Tooltips

**WARNING:** This is a **Stationeers Launchpad Plugin Mod**.  
It requires **BepInEx** to be installed with the Stationeers Launchpad plugin.  
**Installation Guide:** [GitHub - StationeersLaunchPad](https://github.com/StationeersLaunchPad/StationeersLaunchPad)

Cardboard Box Tooltips adds hover tooltips to cardboard boxes, displaying their contents directly in the extended item text ‚Äî allowing for quick inventory checks without opening the box.

## üß© Features

- **Extended Tooltips:** Hover over a cardboard box to see a list of its contents, including item names and stack quantities.
- **Color Coded Display:** Item names and quantities are colorized for better readability.
- **Empty Box Handling:** Clearly indicates if a box is empty or has no storage slots.
- **Ignore List:** Default Stationeers package prefabs (e.g., PortablesPackage, ResidentialPackage, MiningPackage, etc.) are excluded since they already display contents.
- **Limit Protection:** Displays up to 20 items (in case another mod expands box capacity).

## üìù Notes

- Tooltips only appear for **Cardboard Boxes** and integrate seamlessly with the item inspection UI.
- Compatible with mods that expand box storage slots.
